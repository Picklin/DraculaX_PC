Dracula: Once again,
the blood of Belmont\nhas defeated me...
Perhaps this, too,\nis part of my fate.

Richter: Death to you!\nThe world is not yours to exist in!

Dracula: It is not by my own power\nthat I am resurrected.
It is the greed of humanity\nwhich calls me back.
And thus,\nby might, I rule.
Might becomes the one\nand only justice in this world!

Richter: Of all the self serving claptrap!
The same basic faith\ndrives all people to seek,
to come together,\nto move forward.
That surely can't be\nan evil thing!

Dracula: And yet,
here I am.
Do you not have any desires?

Richter: Well...

Dracula: It is by your desires\nthat you humans prosper.
And it is your faith\nwhich has ruled you.
Considering that,
can you really call me evil?

Richter: But people cannot be ruled\nby power alone!
The sacred,
the honorable,
the loved...
Those things can rule humanity.
Something evil will\neventually fall to ruin!

Dracula: I see...
Perhaps you're right.
We shall meet again,\nblood of Belmont!
